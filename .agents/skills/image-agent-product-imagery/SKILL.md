# Product Imagery

## Mission

Create a useful product-image set without allowing visual polish to change what
the customer is buying. This skill is for ecommerce listings, product pages,
catalogs, and commercial campaigns.

## Required inputs

- Product name, SKU/variant, and purchasable quantity.
- Approved product photos, packshots, label/packaging art, or a product sheet.
- Product facts that must remain true: shape, dimensions, material, finish,
  color, logo, controls, included components, and packaging.
- Target channel/category, audience, deliverables, and required formats.
- Product mode: marketplace primary, catalog set, lifestyle campaign, reseller
  refresh, pet-product scene, or another explicitly named use.

Collect when relevant:

- approved claims and prohibited claims;
- primary-image versus secondary/lifestyle/infographic requirements;
- brand guide, art direction, and background preferences;
- model/property release and asset-license state;
- dimensions, scale references, accessibility/alt-text needs, budget, and
  approval owner.

## Model selection

Use [MODELS.md](../../MODELS.md) and [the MuAPI tool reference](../../references/muapi-image-tools.md).
If a public MuAPI recipe such as `amazon-product-listing` matches the brief,
use it as a workflow lead but re-check its current inputs, model, cost, and
platform rules before execution.

## Product modes and source roles

Choose the mode before choosing a model. A single product can have several
roles, but the output must not blur a verified product view with a campaign
concept.

| Mode | Typical roles | Primary preservation rule |
|---|---|---|
| Marketplace listing | clean primary, secondary detail, scale/dimensions, packaging | Exact SKU, quantity, label, background, and category requirements. |
| Catalog or product page | packshot, detail, feature, lifestyle | Product geometry and approved feature language remain fixed. |
| Reseller refresh | background cleanup, crop, lighting, condition-preserving enhancement | Improve presentation without hiding damage or changing the item being sold. |
| Lifestyle campaign | hero scene, use context, seasonal or audience variant | Treat generated setting as creative context; do not invent product performance. |
| Pet or companion-product scene | product plus animal/owner context | Preserve product truth and label animal/owner behavior as illustrative. |
| Multi-angle product set | front, three-quarter, side, back, top-down, macro | Use source-based editing where hidden surfaces or exact geometry matter. |

Label uploaded inputs as `product-primary`, `product-detail`, `packaging`,
`scale`, `style`, `background`, `prop`, or `layout`. `style` and `background`
references may influence composition but must not replace the product identity.

### Multi-angle product rules

Choose only the views needed for the category. A useful starting matrix is:

| View | Typical purpose | Review focus |
|---|---|---|
| Front/primary | listing or catalog baseline | centering, label, color, count |
| Three-quarter/side | silhouette and depth | proportions, seams, controls, closures |
| Back/top-down | rear details or flat lay | hidden surfaces, ports, packaging, scale |
| Macro/detail | material or feature evidence | texture, text, logo, invented detail |
| Hero/lifestyle | campaign context | product truth versus creative setting |

If a supplied reference does not show a hidden side, label that view as a
concept or request an additional source. Do not treat a generated back view as
verified documentation.

## Workflow

1. Read `.image/project.md` and prior product manifests. Confirm the exact SKU
   and separate observed product facts from creative choices.
2. Split the deliverable into channel-specific roles: clean primary, lifestyle
   context, scale/dimensions, feature/detail, packaging, or approved
   comparison. Assign each role to a product mode and do not assume a single
   image can satisfy all roles.
3. Inspect source coverage. Ask for missing views or mark the result as a
   concept/mockup when the supplied reference cannot establish the product's
   hidden sides, material, color, or scale.
4. For a source-based visual, upload the reference via `media.upload_file` and
   prefer editing/product-photography paths that preserve the actual item. Use
   text-to-image for a scene only when it will not be presented as a verified
   product fact. For reseller cleanup, use enhancement/background operations
   before considering a creative edit.
5. Use approved label, logo, packaging, price, certification, and copy assets
   through compositing or post-production where possible. Do not ask the model
   to invent them.
6. State the planned images, calls, model choices, cost signal, and review gate
   before a parallel batch. Run independent roles in parallel only after the
   product facts, mode, and channel scope are confirmed. Keep exact-label and
   dimensions work on a separate review path from lifestyle exploration.
7. Poll and record every variant. Compare product geometry, color, label,
   included quantity, scale, shadows, reflections, and text against the source.
8. Upscale only selected candidates. Return an approval checklist and flag
   anything requiring platform or compliance review.

## Decision rules

- Product truth outranks aesthetics. If the output changes the SKU, label,
  material, quantity, dimensions, or included accessories, it is not a final
  product image.
- Health, beauty, wellness, environmental, safety, comparative, discount,
  certification, rating, and endorsement claims require approved wording and
  review. Visual implication counts as a claim risk.
- Platform requirements are volatile. Check the current official rules for the
  target category, locale, and placement before delivery.
- Keep actual product imagery separate from conceptual campaign imagery.

## Output format

Return a mode/channel/role table with asset ID, source roles, model/tool,
dimensions, output URL, status, product-fidelity observations, claims/platform
limitations, alt-text guidance, and receipt links.

## Failure and missing-data behavior

If product facts or references are incomplete, ask only the questions needed to
protect product truth and label any concept output clearly. If one role fails,
return the independent roles and an explicit failed section; never fill a
missing product view with an invented variant.
