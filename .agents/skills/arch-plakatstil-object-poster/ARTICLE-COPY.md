ROLE:
Act as a Plakatstil / Sachplakat prompt compiler.

INPUT:
The user may provide a text theme, a product photo, a package photo, a portrait/service theme, or a generated poster sample for critique.

TASK:
First identify the best advertising object. If the input is abstract, convert it into one concrete sellable object. If the input is an uploaded image, preserve the object's identity, silhouette, material, label hierarchy, and most recognizable details.

For electronic devices, do not force any specific brand. If the user names a brand, preserve that brand. If no brand is provided, choose a fitting fictional or neutral commercial brand word and make the product feel like a real advertisement.

Then select modules before writing the final prompt:
- source mode
- subject treatment
- typography behavior
- layout family
- background family
- limited lithographic palette
- paper and ink texture
- negative constraints

Do not expose unresolved choices in the final image prompt. The final prompt must be clear, copy-ready, and already decided. Do not use placeholders, slash menus, or "either/or" layout instructions unless the user explicitly asks for a reusable template.

STYLE LOCK:
Keep the style fixed: early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster, one concrete commercial object, simplified but recognizable product hero, custom hand-painted advertising lettering, minimal copy, limited lithographic ink colors, matte printed paper, visible paper grain, ink absorption, slight print registration imperfections, rough painted edges.

CONTENT FREEDOM:
Keep the content flexible. Text may sit above, behind, beside, on the product label, on the package, or partially hidden by the product. The product may be flat, semi-rendered, cropped, diagonal, centered, off-center, or package-led. The background may be a dark flat field, old paper field, color bands, product-derived color block, or worn border if it fits the object.

AVOID:
Avoid clean vector icon, modern logo mockup, Helvetica or Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, comic book title, rock-band lettering, cinematic poster, photorealistic product render, excessive digital grunge, crowded body copy, fake dates, fake URLs, and random unreadable labels.

OUTPUT:
Default resolved mode:
1. selected modules
2. one complete final prompt with no placeholders
3. one sentence explaining the choice

Reusable template mode:
Use this only when the user asks for a copy-ready template, article prompt block, reusable prompt structure, or similar. Put editable Chinese input fields first, then fixed English style instructions. Do not add extra label lines such as “你只需要改这里” or “以下内容不用改”. Distinguish text-to-image prompts from image-to-image prompts.

文章主题或摘要：
{输入文章主题、标题、摘要，或直接粘贴文章内容}

Create an AI article cover from the text theme above.

Style lock:
early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster, hand-painted commercial object poster, one concrete commercial object, simplified but recognizable product hero, custom hand-painted advertising lettering, matte printed paper, visible paper grain, ink absorption, uneven hand-painted color coverage.

Image logic:
Read the article theme and translate it into one memorable physical object. Keep only one dominant object. Do not turn the image into a scene, flowchart, dashboard, UI screenshot, character group, or complicated information structure.

Typography:
If a main title is specified above, use that exact Chinese text. If it says “自动判断”, extract a short Chinese main title from the theme, usually 2-4 Chinese characters. Add one smaller subtitle only when it helps explain the article value or guide reading; if the image is stronger without a subtitle, omit it.

Controlled freedom:
Do not use a fixed template for composition, palette, title position, subtitle position, or background. Let the object metaphor, crop, title shape, background structure, color contrast, and subtitle use adapt to the theme while keeping one-object Plakatstil logic stable.

Avoid:
clean vector icon, modern UI, infographic, flowchart, dashboard, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, photorealistic product render, glossy 3D, cinematic lighting, crowded body copy, multiple competing objects, fake Chinese characters, wrong title text, English replacement text, more than one subtitle line.

Use the uploaded product or object photo as the source image and transform it into an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster.

Style lock:
hand-painted commercial object poster, one dominant product hero, simplified but recognizable silhouette, custom hand-painted advertising lettering, matte printed paper, visible paper grain, ink absorption, uneven hand-painted color coverage.

Image logic:
Keep only one core object from the uploaded image. Preserve brand marks, labels, packaging hierarchy, distinctive materials and functional details when they matter to recognition. Remove modern lifestyle context, desks, UI screens, complicated backgrounds and extra props unless they are essential to the product identity.

Controlled freedom:
Do not force one fixed layout or palette. Let the product angle, crop, title placement, background family, decorative marks and color contrast adapt to the uploaded object, while preserving the object's identity and the Plakatstil commercial object logic.

Avoid:
photorealistic product render, modern launch poster, clean vector icon, sterile sans-serif typography, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, glossy 3D, cinematic lighting, dashboard UI, lifestyle scene, multiple competing products, QR code, barcode, fake labels, fake Chinese characters, wrong title text, random unreadable small text.

Style lock:
Plakatstil-inspired service poster, simplified hand-painted portrait, one hero figure, custom hand-painted advertising lettering, matte printed paper, visible paper grain, ink absorption, uneven hand-painted color coverage.

Image logic:
This is not strict Sachplakat product advertising. Treat it as a Plakatstil-inspired personal, service, performer, lecture, course, creator or consultant poster. Keep one person as the hero figure. Add one small trade object, badge, label, or service cue only if it clarifies the role.

Controlled freedom:
Do not force one fixed portrait crop, palette, or title position. Let the face simplification, crop, lettering placement, background structure and color contrast adapt to the uploaded portrait, while preserving the person's identity and the old hand-painted advertising poster logic.

Avoid:
photorealistic portrait, modern influencer poster, cinematic lighting, anime style, comic book style, luxury fashion ad, clean vector portrait, sterile sans-serif typography, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, excessive grunge, extra slogans, fake Chinese characters, wrong title text, random unreadable small text.

下面这些不是固定模板，而是“模块已经选好”的成品 prompt。主题可以是现代物品，但成图逻辑仍然是早期商品广告。品牌可以真实、虚构或中性；只有用户明确指定时才锁定品牌。

### 01｜无线耳机：AURAL

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a modern wireless earbud advertisement. Main brand word: "AURAL". Product word: "HOERER".

AD OBJECT:
One pair of small wireless earbuds and one open charging case.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the charging case as a simplified cream object with two dark earbuds inside, slightly cropped and monumental. Keep the object recognizable as a modern earbud case, but repaint it as if it were a vintage consumer appliance advertisement.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Use a large custom hand-painted "AURAL" brand word in dull blue, placed behind the product and partially hidden by the open case. Add one small muted red product word "HOERER". The lettering should feel hand-cut and commercial, not modern tech branding.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use an object-over-brand layout with a deep brown-black flat field. Place the case in the lower center, slightly tilted, with large negative space around the brand word.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use limited lithographic inks: dark brown-black, dull blue, warm cream, muted red, and a little ochre shadow.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Visible paper fibers, matte ink, ink absorption at edges, rough painted contours, and slight lithographic registration shifts.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the earbud shape simplify naturally, but keep the product legible and the composition sparse.

AVOID:
Avoid clean vector icon, modern keynote-style product render, futuristic glow, Helvetica, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, comic lettering, fake UI text, extra fake logos, and digital grunge overlay.

QUALITY CHECK:
The image should feel like a real vintage product advertisement for a modern object, not a modern tech poster.

### 02｜机械键盘：KLANG

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a mechanical keyboard advertisement. Main brand word: "KLANG". Product word: "TASTATUR".

One compact mechanical keyboard with tall keycaps and one accent key.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the keyboard as a cropped product macro from a low front angle. Simplify the keys into chunky hand-painted blocks, keeping the stepped rows and one red accent key.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Use a large cream hand-painted "KLANG" word along the upper left edge, with uneven brush-cut terminals. Put "TASTATUR" as smaller black lettering printed on the red accent key, as if the product label is part of the object.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a diagonal hero crop. The keyboard enters from the lower right and fills the bottom half. Keep a warm aged paper field behind it with a worn printed border.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use cream paper, black ink, ochre shadows, muted red accent, and dark tobacco brown.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use visible paper grain, matte pigment, slightly uneven key edges, mild misregistration around the red key, and rubbed border corners.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Allow the exact key layout to simplify, but keep the keyboard clearly recognizable and commercially centered.

AVOID:
Avoid RGB lighting, gaming neon, clean 3D render, modern UI mockup, Helvetica, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, fake app icons, and crowded key labels.

QUALITY CHECK:
It should read as an old product poster for a tactile keyboard, not a modern gaming advertisement.

### 03｜智能手表：ZEIT

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a smartwatch advertisement. Main brand word: "ZEIT". Product word: "UHR".

AD OBJECT:
One square smartwatch with a simple strap and one bold dial mark.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the smartwatch as a semi-rendered metal-and-glass object, simplified into a strong square face, dark strap, and one cream dial mark. Keep light reflections hand-painted and flat, not photographic.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Place the large brand word "ZEIT" as cream hand-painted letters partly behind the watch face. Add a small muted blue "UHR" under the strap. The type should feel like a painted commercial wordmark.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a centered object-over-brand layout with two muted horizontal color bands behind the watch, inspired by old technical product ads.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use dark blue-black, cream, muted blue, dull ochre, and rust red as limited lithographic colors.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use matte paper grain, hand-painted glass highlights, slight color offset at the watch edge, and ink absorption in the dark background.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the watch face remain simple and iconic, but preserve the modern smartwatch silhouette.

AVOID:
Avoid futuristic interface screens, app icons, glowing OLED effects, photorealism, clean vector icon, Helvetica, Swiss grid, fake health dashboard text, and sci-fi poster language.

QUALITY CHECK:
The poster should sell a modern watch as if it were an early 20th-century commercial object.
```

### 04｜Starbucks 咖啡袋：STARBUCKS

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a Starbucks coffee bag advertisement. Main brand word: "STARBUCKS". Product word: "COFFEE".

Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the Starbucks coffee bag as a package-led hero object with folded paper creases, a blocky printed label, and a simplified circular siren-style emblem. The wrapper text should participate in the poster, not look like a modern mockup.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Use "STARBUCKS" as large hand-painted cream letters in the background. Print "STARBUCKS COFFEE" again on the bag label in dark ink and muted red, with uneven letterpress edges.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a package close-up layout. Place the bag diagonally across the lower right, cropped slightly, against a deep tobacco green field with a narrow worn cream border.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use Starbucks green muted into old lithographic ink, warm cream, kraft ochre, dark brown, and muted red.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Emphasize paper fibers, matte kraft paper, ink absorption, rough label lines, and slight print registration imperfection.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the fold structure, circular emblem, and label proportions adapt to the bag, but keep the copy minimal and product-led.

AVOID:
Avoid cafe lifestyle scene, steam drama, photorealistic bag mockup, modern minimalist packaging, clean vector logo, perfectly reproduced corporate logo, Swiss grid, and excessive body copy.

QUALITY CHECK:
The result should feel like a vintage grocery advertisement built around one Starbucks coffee package.
```

### 05｜Sony 镜头：SONY

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a Sony camera lens advertisement. Main brand word: "SONY". Product word: "LENS".

AD OBJECT:

Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the Sony lens as a semi-rendered glass-and-metal object, cropped large from the right edge. Paint the glass front as simplified dark concentric rings with two flat blue and cream highlights, and render the focus ring as a few bold hand-painted grooves.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Set "SONY" as large ochre hand-painted letters behind the circular lens, partly hidden by the object. Add "LENS" in small muted red lettering near the lower left.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use an edge-crop object-over-brand layout on a dark blue-black field. Keep the left side sparse so the Sony word has weight.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use dark blue-black, ochre, cream, muted red, and dull cyan highlights.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use matte ink, visible paper tooth, hand-painted circular contours, subtle color misregistration at the lens rings, and worn poster edges.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the ring count and tiny lens markings simplify, but keep the object immediately readable as a Sony camera lens.

AVOID:
Avoid photorealistic studio product render, glossy 3D, sci-fi HUD, clean vector icon, modern camera catalog layout, Helvetica, fake camera body, and excessive technical microtext.

QUALITY CHECK:
The poster should feel like a Plakatstil optical goods ad for a Sony lens, not a modern camera catalog render.
```

### 06｜Anker 充电宝：ANKER

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for an Anker portable power bank advertisement. Main brand word: "ANKER". Product word: "POWERCORE".

AD OBJECT:
One Anker portable power bank with a dark graphite rectangular body, one short charging cable, and a small blue port accent.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:

TYPOGRAPHY:
Paint "ANKER" as large black hand-cut letters across the cream background. Put "POWERCORE" as small blue label text printed on the side of the power bank.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a split field: cream aged paper on the upper left and dark brown-black on the lower right. Place the power bank horizontally across the split, with the red cable looping into the dark field.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use cream paper, black, dark brown, muted red, Anker blue muted into old lithographic ink, and ochre shadow.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use visible paper grain, uneven ink coverage, absorbed edges, hand-painted cable contour, slight registration shift, and matte printed surface.

Let ports and details simplify, but keep the object recognizable as an Anker portable power bank.

Avoid glowing electricity effects, USB icons everywhere, clean app-style vector, modern tech launch-page aesthetics, neon gradients, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, comic energy bolts, forced famous-brand cues, and fake specification text.

```

### 07｜手机：NOVA

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a modern smartphone advertisement. Main brand word: "NOVA". Product word: "TELEFON".

AD OBJECT:
One slim rectangular smartphone with a dark glass screen and one visible side button.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the smartphone as a monumental black glass slab, simplified into a strong rectangle with rounded corners, one muted cream screen reflection, and a small red side button. Preserve the modern phone silhouette, but repaint it as a flat hand-painted commercial object.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Use a large custom hand-painted "NOVA" brand word in warm cream, placed vertically along the left side and partly overlapped by the phone edge. Add "TELEFON" as small muted red product text near the lower right, aligned to the object rather than floating like a modern UI caption.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a corner-crop layout. Let the phone enter from the right edge at a slight angle, occupying most of the right half. Keep a deep blue-black field with wide negative space on the left for the brand word.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use limited lithographic inks: deep blue-black, warm cream, dark graphite, muted red, and a small ochre highlight.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use visible paper grain through the dark ink, hand-painted screen reflection, slight ink absorption around the phone silhouette, mild print registration shift at the red button, and matte old poster surface.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the glass highlight and corner radius adapt naturally, but keep the phone as one simple product hero without interface clutter.

AVOID:
Avoid app icons, glowing UI, futuristic holograms, clean vector mockup, photorealistic phone render, forced famous-brand cues, Helvetica, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, cinematic lighting, and crowded technical text.

QUALITY CHECK:
The image should feel like a vintage product advertisement for a modern telephone, not a smartphone launch keynote poster.
```

### 08｜笔记本电脑：WERK

```text
SOURCE / INPUT:
Text theme for a modern laptop advertisement. Main brand word: "WERK". Product word: "RECHNER".

AD OBJECT:
One open laptop with a thin screen, keyboard plane, and simple hinge.

STYLE LOCK:
Create an early 20th-century German Plakatstil / Sachplakat advertising poster: simplified commercial object poster, hand-painted lithographic look, minimal copy, bold product silhouette, custom advertising lettering, matte printed paper.

SUBJECT TREATMENT:
Show the open laptop as a cropped product macro, simplified into two strong planes: a dark screen rectangle and a warm cream keyboard base. Keep the hinge and keyboard rows visible as rough painted marks, not precise modern UI detail.

TYPOGRAPHY:
Paint "WERK" as large black hand-cut letters across the warm cream background, partly hidden by the open laptop screen. Put "RECHNER" as small dull blue product text printed on the lower keyboard base, as if it were a product label.

LAYOUT + BACKGROUND:
Use a split-field package-like layout. Place the laptop open at a three-quarter angle across the center, with the screen rising into a dark brown-black upper field and the base resting on an aged cream lower field. Leave the lower left corner quiet.

COLOR + PRINT:
Use cream paper, dark brown-black, graphite black, dull blue, muted ochre, and a small rust-red accent on one key.

PAPER / INK TEXTURE:
Use matte lithographic ink, visible paper fibers, rough painted keyboard rows, uneven edge absorption around the screen, slight color misregistration on the blue product text, and a subtly worn printed border.

CONTROLLED FREEDOM:
Let the exact keyboard marks simplify, but keep the laptop immediately recognizable as an open portable computer.

AVOID:
Avoid modern laptop product photography, glowing screen UI, software windows, clean vector icon, forced famous-brand cues, neon gradient, Swiss grid, Bauhaus geometry, cinematic workstation scene, and dense spec-sheet text.

QUALITY CHECK:
The result should feel like a plausible early product advertisement for a portable computer, translated into Plakatstil language.
