# 成品示例：一整篇文章的封面 + 插图系列

样例文章：《Loop 刚讲完，Graph Engineering 又来了？0 基础一篇讲透，附多 Agent 分工提示词》
图面族：全篇 TOPOLOGY（封面）+ SPLIT COMPARE / 图例板 / 对照 / 拓扑（插图）。HUD 预设：HUD-FULL（封面）配 HUD-EDGE 级精简（插图）。质感档：CRT-02 STANDARD。封面 5:2，插图 16:9。

注意下面每条里的 `SCREEN TEXTURE` 段是**一字不差重复**的——这是整篇成系列的一半功劳，改档要六条一起改。

> 这一篇是**图面族扩容之前**做的，全篇只用了拓扑族和拉丁标签，HUD 也是手写不是预设，看结构和文风照抄没问题。要看新增能力（非拓扑族 / 中文标签 / HUD-EDGE）怎么落地，看文末「新能力示例」那节。

## 封面（5:2）

> 带大标题的封面必带「标题图文分离铁律」四条（净空+绕行 / 明度分层 / 字重分层 / 净空带 knockout），加上质感层那条「辉光和扫描线一起吃字」的补充，见 compile-contract.md。下面是应用后的成品。

```text
STYLE ANCHOR — a technical schematic screen rendered as a phosphor CRT terminal: an engineering topology diagram drawn in glowing monospace, like a system-monitor HUD.

A 5:2 landscape poster.

LOCKED — pure black background that lifts into a faint dark halo around anything lit; one neon-green phosphor hue for everything, but with a strong brightness hierarchy — the title is bright near-white green with a heavy bloom, the schematic lines are a dimmer mid-green; all schematic linework shares one uniform thin stroke weight while the title is set in heavy bold type; soft outer glow on lit elements; monospace typeface for all Latin text; the drawn content is flat line-art with no photographic depth and no gradient fill.

LAYOUT — a wide horizontal clear band is reserved across the center for the title; the topology is routed so its edges sweep in two arcs, one above and one below this central band, and never cross behind the title.

DOMINANT VISUAL — one wide node-and-edge topology: a single ENTRY node on the far left fans out to six labeled circular agent nodes, their edges arc over and under the central title band and converge into a MERGE column on the right, then to one EXIT node on the far right; small glowing dots ride the edges; each agent node holds a tiny line-icon (magnifier, bar-chart, code brackets, checkmark, clipboard, document); nodes are thin-stroked circles.

TITLE TREATMENT — the main title sits centered in a clear horizontal band with generous padding that no linework crosses; rendered very large and dominating the composition, bright near-white-green, heavy weight, strong green bloom — clearly the brightest, boldest element on screen.

HUD FRAME — top-left metadata block (PROJECT / TYPE: FAN-OUT·FAN-IN / VERSION); top-right legend keying NODE / EDGE / FLOW / EXIT; a bottom row of short system-status fields (SYS READY / LINK ACTIVE / [ok]); thin dimension ruler with tick marks along the bottom edge; corner crop marks — all kept dim so they never compete with the title.

TYPOGRAPHY — monospace for all Latin text; the Chinese title is set in a heavy Chinese sans (思源黑体 / Source Han Sans, Heavy).

TEXT — main title must render verbatim, with no extra words or characters added: "从 Loop 到 Graph". One small subtitle line beneath it, also verbatim: "多 Agent 分工提示词 · 附模板". Secondary labels are short Latin field tags only (ENTRY, A1–A6, MERGE, EXIT, FAN-OUT); no dates, URLs, fake brands, long paragraphs, QR codes, or real code.

SCREEN TEXTURE — the whole frame is a close photograph of a monochrome phosphor CRT monitor. Fine horizontal scanlines run edge to edge at even spacing, dark and low in contrast, riding over every element including the title, and their brightness varies subtly from band to band as if the tube is mid-refresh. Under them sits a much finer vertical aperture-grille striping, visible only inside lit areas as phosphor grain. Lit strokes bloom and halate into the scanlines around them, brightest where two lines cross. The picture bows outward in gentle barrel curvature, falls off into a soft vignette at the four corners, and defocuses very slightly at the extreme edges. A faint even haze of glass lies over the whole surface. Every glyph stays sharp and fully legible through the texture.

AVOID — any hue beyond neon green; blueprint blue; RGB colour split, chromatic aberration or rainbow subpixel fringing; scanlines heavy or wide enough to break up the title glyphs; a visible monitor bezel, plastic housing, desk or room around the screen; edges crossing behind the title; title at the same brightness as the diagram lines; photographic objects or depth of field inside the artwork itself; 3D bevels; hard specular glare sitting over the content; dense unreadable code walls.

QUALITY — crisp phosphor CRT terminal render shot straight off a real screen, sharp monospace holding up through the scanline texture, precise alignment, strong bloom on the title, dim schematic behind it.

STYLE ANCHOR — a technical schematic screen rendered as a phosphor CRT terminal: an engineering topology diagram drawn in glowing monospace, like a system-monitor HUD.

A 16:9 poster.

LOCKED — pure black background that lifts into a faint dark halo around anything lit; a single neon-green phosphor color for every line, node, glyph and label; all schematic linework shares one uniform thin stroke weight; soft outer glow on lit elements; monospace typeface for all Latin text; the drawn content is flat line-art with no photographic depth and no gradient fill.

DOMINANT VISUAL — a split diagram divided by one thin vertical rule: on the left, a single circular node with a looping arrow curving back into itself, tiny label LOOP; on the right, a small cluster of six circular nodes connected by edges into a diamond, tiny label GRAPH; nodes are thin-stroked circles, edges carry small glowing dots.

HUD FRAME — top-left small metadata tag; top-right tiny legend NODE / EDGE; thin dimension ruler with ticks along the bottom edge; corner crop marks; minimal.

TYPOGRAPHY — monospace for all Latin text; only tiny Latin field labels LOOP and GRAPH, no large title.

TEXT — only the two field labels LOOP and GRAPH plus corner tags; no other text, no dates, no code.

SCREEN TEXTURE — the whole frame is a close photograph of a monochrome phosphor CRT monitor. Fine horizontal scanlines run edge to edge at even spacing, dark and low in contrast, riding over every element, and their brightness varies subtly from band to band as if the tube is mid-refresh.

The picture bows outward in gentle barrel curvature, falls off into a soft vignette at the four corners, and defocuses very slightly at the extreme edges. A faint even haze of glass lies over the whole surface. Every glyph stays sharp and fully legible through the texture.

AVOID — any color beyond the single neon green; blueprint blue; RGB colour split, chromatic aberration or rainbow subpixel fringing; scanlines heavy or wide enough to break up the glyphs; a visible monitor bezel, plastic housing, desk or room around the screen; photographic objects or depth of field inside the artwork itself; 3D bevels; hard specular glare sitting over the content; large title type; dense code walls.

## 新能力示例

下面两条演示扩容后的三样东西：非拓扑族、短中文标签、HUD-EDGE。两条同属一篇（HUD-EDGE + CRT-02），可以并排看一致性。

### 示例 A（16:9）— BAR RANK 条形排行 + 中文标签

```text
STYLE ANCHOR — a technical schematic screen rendered as a phosphor CRT terminal: an engineering bar chart drawn in glowing monospace, like a system-monitor HUD.

A 16:9 poster.

LOCKED — pure black background that lifts into a faint dark halo around anything lit; a single neon-green phosphor color for every line, node, glyph and label; all schematic linework shares one uniform thin stroke weight; soft outer glow on lit elements; monospace typeface for all Latin text; the drawn content is flat line-art with no photographic depth and no gradient fill.

DOMINANT VISUAL — a horizontal bar chart of five rows, flat line-art: each row is a thin-outlined rectangle filled with an even lattice of small squares whose count encodes the value, bars sorted longest to shortest, a label sitting flush left of each bar and a short numeric readout flush right; one thin baseline axis with tick marks runs under the bars.

HUD FRAME — a single thin dimension ruler with tick marks along the bottom edge; corner crop marks; nothing else.

TYPOGRAPHY — monospace for all Latin text and all numerals; Chinese row labels in a heavy Chinese sans (思源黑体 / Source Han Sans, Heavy), small and set flush left.

TEXT — no large title. The following five row labels must render verbatim, with no extra words or characters added: "写稿", "配图", "排版", "分发", "复盘". Each bar carries a short numeric readout at its right end. Remaining labels are short Latin field tags only; no years or calendar dates, URLs, fake brands, long paragraphs, QR codes, or real code.

SCREEN TEXTURE — the whole frame is a close photograph of a monochrome phosphor CRT monitor. Fine horizontal scanlines run edge to edge at even spacing, dark and low in contrast, riding over every element, and their brightness varies subtly from band to band as if the tube is mid-refresh. Under them sits a much finer vertical aperture-grille striping, visible only inside lit areas as phosphor grain. Lit strokes bloom and halate into the scanlines around them, brightest where two lines cross. The picture bows outward in gentle barrel curvature, falls off into a soft vignette at the four corners, and defocuses very slightly at the extreme edges. A faint even haze of glass lies over the whole surface. Every glyph stays sharp and fully legible through the texture.

AVOID — any hue beyond the single neon green; blueprint blue; RGB colour split, chromatic aberration or rainbow subpixel fringing; scanlines heavy or wide enough to break up the glyphs; a visible monitor bezel, plastic housing, desk or room around the screen; solid filled bars; two competing sets of tick-marked scales; varying stroke weights inside the linework; photographic objects or depth of field inside the artwork itself; 3D bevels; hard specular glare sitting over the content; garbled or invented Chinese characters; large title type; dense code walls.

QUALITY — crisp phosphor CRT terminal render shot straight off a real screen, sharp monospace holding up through the scanline texture, precise alignment, subtle bloom.
```

要点：条形**用方块点阵填充不用实心块**（AVOID 里专门加了 `solid filled bars`）；五个中文标签逐个列进 TEXT 并要求 verbatim；图面自带底轴，所以 HUD 退到 EDGE 只留一条标尺，AVOID 里补 `two competing sets of tick-marked scales` 兜底。

### 示例 B（16:9）— STACK 层级堆叠 + 中文标签

```text
STYLE ANCHOR — a technical schematic screen rendered as a phosphor CRT terminal: an engineering layer stack drawn in glowing monospace, like a system-monitor HUD.

A 16:9 poster.

LOCKED — pure black background that lifts into a faint dark halo around anything lit; a single neon-green phosphor color for every line, node, glyph and label; all schematic linework shares one uniform thin stroke weight; soft outer glow on lit elements; monospace typeface for all Latin text; the drawn content is flat line-art with no photographic depth and no gradient fill.

DOMINANT VISUAL — a vertical stack of four horizontal bands, flat line-art: each band a thin-outlined rectangle spanning most of the width, stacked with even gaps, a label centered inside each band and a short Latin tier tag flush right, thin vertical connector ticks joining adjacent bands.

HUD FRAME — a single thin dimension ruler with tick marks along the left edge; corner crop marks; nothing else.

TYPOGRAPHY — monospace for all Latin text; Chinese band labels in a heavy Chinese sans (思源黑体 / Source Han Sans, Heavy), centered inside each band.

TEXT — no large title. The following four band labels must render verbatim, with no extra words or characters added: "素材", "成稿", "已发布", "内容资产". Tier tags on the right are short Latin field tags (L1 / L2 / L3 / L4); no years or calendar dates, URLs, fake brands, long paragraphs, QR codes, or real code.

SCREEN TEXTURE — the whole frame is a close photograph of a monochrome phosphor CRT monitor. Fine horizontal scanlines run edge to edge at even spacing, dark and low in contrast, riding over every element, and their brightness varies subtly from band to band as if the tube is mid-refresh. Under them sits a much finer vertical aperture-grille striping, visible only inside lit areas as phosphor grain. Lit strokes bloom and halate into the scanlines around them, brightest where two lines cross. The picture bows outward in gentle barrel curvature, falls off into a soft vignette at the four corners, and defocuses very slightly at the extreme edges. A faint even haze of glass lies over the whole surface. Every glyph stays sharp and fully legible through the texture.

AVOID — any hue beyond the single neon green; blueprint blue; RGB colour split, chromatic aberration or rainbow subpixel fringing; scanlines heavy or wide enough to break up the glyphs; a visible monitor bezel, plastic housing, desk or room around the screen; filled or shaded bands; varying stroke weights inside the linework; photographic objects or depth of field inside the artwork itself; 3D bevels; hard specular glare sitting over the content; garbled or invented Chinese characters; large title type; dense code walls.

QUALITY — crisp phosphor CRT terminal render shot straight off a real screen, sharp monospace holding up through the scanline texture, precise alignment, subtle bloom.
```

要点：band 里**不填色只放字**；中文标签 4 个，远在 8 个上限之内；HUD 和 SCREEN TEXTURE 跟示例 A 一字不差，所以两张并排是同一系列。

## 换质感强度怎么改

只动 `SCREEN TEXTURE` 一段，其余不动，六条一起换：

- 想更干净（插图字太多、标题太长）→ 整段换成 `compile-contract.md` 的 **CRT-01 CLEAN**。
- 想更旧、更有故障感和年代感 → 整段换成 **CRT-03 DEGRADED**，并在 AVOID 末尾补一句 `noise or ghosting strong enough to obscure any label`。

不要只给封面上重档、插图上轻档——同一篇里质感档不一致，缩略图并排一眼就散。

## 想要蓝图版？

蓝底白线的工程图纸不在这里改配色——它已经拆成独立 skill `engineering-blueprint-sheet`，那边有自己的线型分级、尺寸标注、标题栏、修订表和三档纸张质感，不是把绿换成蓝就能得到的。直接用那个 skill。
